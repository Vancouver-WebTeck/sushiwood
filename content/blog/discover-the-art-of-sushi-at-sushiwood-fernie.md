## The Story Behind Sushi


Sushi dates back over a thousand years to Japan, where it was originally a method of preserving fish in fermented rice. Over time, it evolved into the beautifully crafted dishes we know today—featuring fresh fish, perfectly seasoned rice, and a delicate balance of flavors. Whether you’re dining at a Fernie restaurant or exploring new culinary experiences, sushi remains a symbol of precision and dedication.
